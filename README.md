### Hi there :wave: :sparkles: 

I am the author of this readme, Yes, this what I do in life, nothing more! :shipit:

I am a Software Engineer, I work and live in Berlin.

- I am Egyptian and this is a nice part in my life :egypt: :heart:

- I use rails to break down stuff, but I use ruby to fix it.

- I use my mind, and it’s something rare nowadays, believe me!

- This is my Linkedin, I am not an active writer there <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamedbarakats/">But they say that it’s professional to have one</a> :man:

For more information about me (only me, who can tell that), feel free to contact :heart: :eagle: 

it’s been a pleasure, hosting you here with a Non-alcoholic beer, bye!
